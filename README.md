💫 About Me:
Hi! I’m Ariba, a flutter developer, and a UI designer. I have developed a number of multi-platform apps for my clients using Google’s Flutter development and Figma. Apart from that, I have completed my bachelor’s degree of four years in Software engineering, which I rigorously apply in building quality apps and designs and now I’m gladly available on LinkedIn for my services and looking forward to working with you!
